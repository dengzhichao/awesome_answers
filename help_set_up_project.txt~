rails bundler in action:
Gemfile:
gem 'rails', '4.2.4' -> specific gem version, if it is found, then bundler will not install, if not then bundler will

gem 'sass-rails', '~> 5.0' -> this will accept any gem with version 5.x

gem 'uglifier', '>=1.3.0' -> greater than or equal to

if no version -> it's going to use the latest from your ruby installation, or will install the latest

action:
1. Bundler will look your installed gem for  a gem that qualifies the criteria given in Gemfile
2. If gem not found, bundler will install the latest that qualifies from the source above (rubygems.org)
3. Bundler will update Gemfile.lock with thta version ---> Gemfile .lock will contain the EACH version that was accepted for the given machine (it helps different developers to be on the same page)

bundler will require all the gems by default for your environment, unless you specify option: require: false
